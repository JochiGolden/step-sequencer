This is meant to be a simple step sequencer using `<audio>` and a bit of JS magic
to create sweet drum grooves, for fun.

It's just some experimentation on my end, see what I can achieve with it.

Working so far (only tested in latest stable Chrome at this point)

* 4 tracks (kick, clap, hihat, snare), you can sequence a single bar at step resolution
* Play / stop buttons
* Setting the tempo, haven't checked how accurate it is, but *if my calculations are correct* it should be pretty spot on. I blame inaccuracies on the browser.

To do
-----
* Picking and choosing from a range of samples
* Adding/removing sample tracks
* Progress indicator
* Others I can't think of at the moment.
